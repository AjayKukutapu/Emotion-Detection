# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Detection using the FER 2013 dataset.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013/data

In this project we are building a CNN from scratch that would classify images into 7 classes of emotions. We will also use existing models like VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet and compare them to the CNN we have built.

Sample Data from Fer 2013
