# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Detection using the FER 2013 dataset.

In this project we are building a CNN from scratch that would classify images into 7 classes of emotions. We will also use existing models like VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet and compare them to the CNN we have built.

About Dataset
The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
